MP3 Player is a MP3 Player (lol). Use it to listen your music from your audio files stored in your Android phone (Android Upside Down Cake and later). 
This application is still in developpment and contains bugs and bad ui

This entire project is under GNU/GPL v3 and it's applied on all version of this project (even the code pushed from the very first commit.).

If you decide to use my code to create new app, you can but you have to use the same license :p
